      "I study software and web development at my local college. As of now I'm about to enroll into my next years of college after getting my degree.",
      "My specialties are mostly web development, using primarily ReactJS and TypeScript. Using the skills I've acquired while working for [LoyLap](https://www.loylap.com/) in Dublin, Ireland. There I've made a web app for designing giftcards for customer use. There the user can create giftcards by uploading photos using uploadcare, edit and possition text and edit their company data.",
      "Currently I'm working at [Expedient B.V.](https://www.expedient.nl/) for an internship. There they work with C# and .NET, using the DotNetNuke framework. As so far, I've created a new system for the generation of PDF files when you make a checkout in a webshop using ReportViewers. That system makes customizing the PDFs a lot easier.",
      "I've Done courses on HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS and React Hooks. In college I've studied C#, .NET and SQL. Java is on the way!"
