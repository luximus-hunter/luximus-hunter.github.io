      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>I'm Thomas, a junior software developer.</p>
      <p>
        I study software and web development at my local college. As of now I'm about to enroll into
        my next years of college after getting my degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        My specialties are mostly web development, using primarily ReactJS and TypeScript. Using the
        skills I've acquired while working for <a href='https://www.loylap.com/'>LoyLap</a> in
        Dublin, Ireland. There I've made a web app for designing giftcards for customer use. There
        the user can create giftcards by uploading photos using uploadcare, edit and possition text
        and edit their company data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I'm working at <a href='https://www.expedient.nl/'>Expedient B.V.</a> for an
        internship. There they work with C# and .NET, using the DotNetNuke framework. As so far,
        I've created a new system for the generation of PDF files when you make a checkout in a
        webshop using ReportViewers. That system makes customizing the PDFs a lot easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've Done courses on HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS and React Hooks. In
        college I've studied C#, .NET and SQL. Java is on the way!
